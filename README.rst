INSTALLATION
============

This Python 3 library contains code to reproduce results in
[A modular architecture for transparent computation in Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01926.pdf) .

To install it with `pip`, enter the root folder of the project and run:

```
pip install .
```

Examples are placed in the `examples` folder, and can be run after installing the library.

The easiest way to install Python 3, NumPy and Matplotlib is to
download Anaconda, a Python distribution including a selection of the
most important scientific libraries, available at
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
