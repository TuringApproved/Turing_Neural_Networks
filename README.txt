INSTALLATION
============

These modules have been coded in Python 2.7.

The modules simpleNNlib, symdyn and neuraltm depend on the Python
scientific computing library NumPy (version 1.8.2).

Together with the core modules, code is included reproducing the
example in "From Neural Networks to Turing Machines, parsimoniously".
The example code has an additional dependence on the Python plotting
library Matplotlib (version 1.4.3).

The easiest way to install Python 2.7, NumPy and Matplotlib is to
download Anaconda, a Python distribution including a selection of the
most important scientific libraries, available at
http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html.
