Introduction
============

This files documents the code used in the paper
[A modular architecture for transparent computation in Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01926.pdf),
implementing the presented mapping. In the
example included with the code it is possible to observe how to create
a Neural Network simulating the computation of any arbitrary Turing
Machine given the Machine description.

For the most up-to-date version of the code and documentation please

For installation instructions, follow the README.txt included with the
code.
