Introduction
============

This files documents the code used in the paper "From Turing Machines
to Neural Networks", implementing the presented mapping. In the
example included with the code it is possible to observe how to create
a Neural Network simulating the computation of any arbitrary Turing
Machine given the Machine description.

For the most up-to-date version of the code and documentation please
visit the git repository at
https://github.com/TuringApproved/Turing_Neural_Networks.

For installation instructions, follow the README.txt included with the
code.
